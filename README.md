# Overview
Our company has released a beta version of **String Reply Service** and it has been a huge success.
In the current implementation (as part of boilerplate code), the **String Reply Service** takes in an input string (in the format of `[a-z0-9]*`)
and returns the input in a JSON object.

For example,

```
GET /reply/kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```

As the service is widely adopted, there have been increasing feature requests.
Our project manager has come back with the following requirements for V2 of the service:

The input string will now be comprised of two components, a rule and a string, separated by a dash (-).
Rules **for now** contain two numbers. Each number represents a string operation.

The supported numbers are:

- `1`: reverse the string

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `ur9wzbk`

- `2`: encode the string via MD5 hash algorithm and display as hex

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `0fafeaae780954464c1b29f765861fad`

The numbers are applied in sequence, i.e. the output of the first rule will
serve as the input of the second rule. The numbers can also be repeated,
i.e. a rule of 11 would mean reversing the string twice, resulting in no change to the string.

Giving a few examples,

```
GET /v2/reply/11-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/12-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "5a8973b3b1fafaeaadf10e195c6e1dd4"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/22-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "e8501e64cf0a9fa45e3c25aa9e77ffd5"
}
```
